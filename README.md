# Book-Recommendation-System
Built a Book Recommendation System using collaborative filtering to suggest personalized books based on user preferences. Processed over 1.1 million ratings from the Book-Crossing dataset involving 270K+ users and 27K+ books. Filtered the dataset to retain users with at least 200 ratings and books with over 50 ratings for meaningful recommendations. Constructed a user-item interaction matrix and applied cosine similarity with KNN to identify similar users. Used Scikit-learnâ€™s NearestNeighbors algorithm to generate Top-10 book suggestions. Addressed data sparsity by pruning inactive users and rarely rated books, resulting in an efficient and accurate recommendation engine suitable for real-world use
